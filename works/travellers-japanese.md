This is the second app that I've made about learning Japanese. This app was made before 
React Native was a tool available for mobile development, thus it was developed 
using Cordova / Phonegap and Web technologies. 
I used a angular on  the front end. 
It is able to dynamically receive and store 
new content from the server without requiring an update.
I've made this app in collaboration with a friend of mine.

The UX and UI is the important part, since we designed them from scratch. We 
wanted to be able simply correlate a sentence in Japanese to English.
