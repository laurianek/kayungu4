Developed both the frontend and the backend for project, the hair & beauty app 
'hairbook'. It is live with over 8000 downloads without any marketing. Used 
Cordova hybrid mobile app framework with ReactJS on the client side, and NodeJS 
+ ExpressJS on the server side. I have plans to convert this app to a full React 
Native app in the future. It has the ability to push hotfixes for bugs and to 
sync user data from the backend.
