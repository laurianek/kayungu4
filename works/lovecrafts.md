Worked on a team with this innovative startup aiming to bridge the gap between 
art & crafts social media and where they shop for supplies. I worked on both 
the social media and e-commerce part of the site. The social media aspect uses 
Symfony2 and backbone.js. The ecommerce uses Magento e-commerce platform.

I helped migrate the ecommerce platform of the latest stable version. Worked 
with kanban agile methodology, implementing user stories. Shown flexibility 
taking up different responsibilities, like helping with backend work, quality 
assurance, and writing automated tests. Helped with the planning process and 
priority of tickets.
