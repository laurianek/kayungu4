# Virgin Main Landing Site

Implemented the redesign of Virgin Media.com site, for both prospective and 
current customers. This particular brief included a unified header across all
of Virgin Media subdomains and sites. The header was firstly designed in a 
design software suite and was not responsive via the width of the window. 
I have refactored the generated css into fully functioning responsive design.
