Short one page site for Constant Commerce startup. The site needed to be fully
responsive notably the hero of the site. The image could be responsive but the
text on the image needed to still be readable on smaller devices and not to
feel pixelated. Iâ€™ve developed a responsive font library which allows the
scaling of text between break points making the hero readable whichever
platform you were on.
